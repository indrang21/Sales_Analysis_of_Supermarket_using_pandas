# Sales_Analysis_of_Supermarket_using_pandas
A supermarket is self-service shop offering a wide variety of food, beverages and household products, organized into sections. It is larger and has a wider selection than earlier grocery stores, but is smaller and more limited in the range of merchandise than a hypermarket or big-box market.The growth of supermarkets in most populated cities are increasing and market competitions are also high. In this  project I have used different techniques to analyse the sales data set of supermarket.
## Libraries 
* pandas for data processing
* matplotlib and seaborn for visualization
## Data Source
The dataset for this analysis was gotten from Kaggle. The data was stored in a csv format, it is structured, organized in rows and columns.
This csv file contains 51290 rows and 21 columns. The columns are order_id, order_date, ship_date, ship_mode, customer_name, segment, state, country, market, region, product_id,
category, sub_category, product_name, sales, quantity,
discount, profit, shipping_cost, order_priority, year. There are no null values.
